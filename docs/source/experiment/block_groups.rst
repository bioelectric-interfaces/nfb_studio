This feature is optional, but it could be useful in case you have a lot of repeating blocks during the procedure. These blocks could be embraced inside a group and used together.

**Blocks**: type the names of blocks created previously. For example, “Feedback1; Pause; Feedback2”.

**Repeats** how many times this group will be repeated once activated.

**Random order**: is it needed to create a random sequence of blocks inside a group?
