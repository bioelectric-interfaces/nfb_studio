Saving and importing data
=========================

NFB Studio supports two types of imported settings of the experiment:
  1.	**nfbex** – file extension that was created specifically to NFB Studio. Could be created by choosing “Save” or “Save as” buttons inside “File”. The “Open” button, respectively, opens a window for choosing a nfbex file.
  2.	**xml** – extension that is supported by NFB Lab and NFB Studio as well. “Import” and “Export” buttons are needed to manipulate this type of setting.
